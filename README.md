# C-Chat
Started off as a simple homework task for SoftUni but then I liked working on it and decided to add more features to it. Small project, took several hours. Fun to create. 10/10 would do again.

Homework task:
- refresh button should refresh chat
- send button should post message
- no css
- use Firebase to store the data

Extended version:
- constantly updates chat, eliminating the need for the refresh button (needs to be optimised)
- automatically scrolls to bottom of chat on every refresh to always show the new mesages unless the user has started scrolling
- if the user has started scrolling, the auto-scroll stops untill the user scrolls back to the bottom, and then it is re-enabled
- added  visually pleasing interface
- can send mesage by pressing Enter too
